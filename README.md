# SwiftExtensions
A collection of useful Swift Extensions

All Swift extensions found here are Swift 5.2 compliant for the time being.

You can directly use all the extensions directly into your Swift projects, since they are not dependent on other external libraries/code.

Enjoy and be productive!
