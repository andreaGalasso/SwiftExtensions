# SwiftExtensions
A collection of useful Swift Extensions

All Swift extensions found here are Swift 5.2 compliant for the time being.

You can directly use all the extensions directly into your iOS projects, since they are not dependent on other external libraries/code.

# Plaform Compatibility

Most of the extensions are compatible with iOS projects only, altought some *can* be used also in other Apple plaforms as well (watchOS, macOS, tvOS), since they are language centered and platform independent.

Enjoy and be productive!
